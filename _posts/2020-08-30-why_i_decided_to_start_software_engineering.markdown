My decision to join a Software Engineering program began back in high school. I was first introduced to coding through a JavaScript class. Although it was difficult, I was thrilled to research the language and experience the satisfaction of debugging a file. Despite this, I would go off to college and follow a path of business, figuring coding was too limiting and I didn't have enough experience to compete with others who had started years earlier. Even at my insistence of leaving coding behind for something I thought better, coding showed up in the form of a friend in my dorm who needed help with homework - C++. Even though it was a different language, I was set on figuring it out. This determination (or stubbornness) led me to finish compiling the code a few hours later at 2 am. Unfortunately, such satisfaction didn't push forward toward a career I enjoyed.

Fast forward to 2020, and all hell has broken loose. Thankfully, being an introvert saved me from the deadly virus - my job on the other hand wasn't so fortunate. In April I was laid off along with millions of others. After considering another position within the field, I decided it was time for a change. I explored my options, and after finding out about code boot camps I decided this is what I should have been doing the whole time.

I look forward to learning more.
